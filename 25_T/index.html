                    Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian 
                    polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, 
                    engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. Leonardo is 
                    identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of art and is often 
                    credited as the founder of the High Renaissance. Despite having many lost works and 
                    less than 25 attributed major works—including numerous unfinished works—he created 
                    some of the most influential paintings in Western art. His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, 
                    is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. 
                    The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his 
                    Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, 
                    attributed in whole or part to Leonardo, was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, 
                    setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

                    Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored 
                    fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding 
                    machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible 
                    during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were 
                    only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered 
                    the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for 
                    testing the tensile strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil 
                    engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings 
                    and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.
